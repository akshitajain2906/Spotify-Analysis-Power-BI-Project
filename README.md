## What I Looked At

### 1. Albums, Artists & Tracks  
Total albums, artists, and tracks played were tracked over time, with breakdowns by year and weekday vs weekend. The most played items in each category were highlighted, and year-over-year changes were used to show shifts in engagement.

### 2. Listening Time Patterns  
A heatmap visualized peak listening hours across the week, revealing strong activity during late-night hours.

### 3. Track Frequency vs Listening Time  
A scatter plot was used to compare play counts with listening duration. This helped group tracks into categories such as highly played, long listens, short plays, and lower engagement tracks.

### 4. Drill-Through & Grid View  
Interactive drill-through allowed detailed exploration of any album, artist, or track. A structured grid view supported drill-up/down and export to CSV for further analysis.
